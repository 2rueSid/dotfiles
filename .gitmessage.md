# --- Conventional Commit Types ---
# feat:     A new feature
# fix:      A bug fix
# docs:     Documentation only changes
# style:    Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
#          (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
# refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# perf:     A code change that improves performance
# test:     Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
# build:    Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
# ci:       Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
# chore:    Other changes that don't modify src or test files
# revert:   Reverts a previous commit

# --- What is Scope? ---
# The scope is a term that describes the part of the codebase that is affected.
# It should be a noun describing a section of the codebase, enclosed in parentheses.
# Common scope examples:
# - (api)      - API-related changes
# - (auth)     - Authentication/Authorization related
# - (core)     - Core functionality
# - (db)       - Database related
# - (ui)       - User interface components
# - (deps)     - Dependencies
# - (config)   - Configuration changes
# - (test)     - Test related changes
# - (docs)     - Documentation scope
# Multiple scopes are not allowed: (api,auth): Invalid!

# --- Examples ---
# feat(auth): add login with Google OAuth
# fix(db): resolve connection timeout issue
# docs(api): update endpoint documentation
# style(ui): format CSS according to styleguide
# refactor(core): simplify payment processing logic
# perf(api): improve caching of frequent requests
# test(auth): add unit tests for password reset
# build(deps): update webpack to v5
# ci(github): add new deployment workflow
# chore(deps): update dependencies
# revert: feat(api): add new endpoint

# --- Breaking Changes ---
# 1. Using ! after type/scope:
#    feat(api)!: remove user endpoints
# 
# 2. Using footer:
#    feat(auth): change authentication flow
#    
#    BREAKING CHANGE: Users need to re-authenticate after this change

# --- Full Example ---
# feat(auth): implement multi-factor authentication
#
# Add support for TOTP-based two-factor authentication using Google
# Authenticator. This implementation follows RFC 6238 for the TOTP
# algorithm.
#
# - Add TOTP secret generation
# - Implement QR code generation for easy setup
# - Add verification endpoint
# - Update user settings to enable/disable 2FA
#
# BREAKING CHANGE: Users will need to re-authenticate
